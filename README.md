## Overview
InCollege is a LinkedIn-like platform for college students, implemented in COBOL. The program provides user registration, login functionality, and basic navigation features.

## Features
- User account creation with password validation (8-12 chars, 1 uppercase, 1 digit, 1 special character)
- Account persistence using indexed file storage
- 5-account limit per system
- Login with unlimited attempts
- Create and edit personal profiles
  - Required fields: First Name, Last Name, University, Major, Graduation Year
  - Optional fields: About Me, Work Experience (up to 3 entries), Education (up to 3 entries)
- Profile validation and persistence
- View complete profile information
- Post-login navigation: Profile Management, Search for User, Learn New Skills
- User search functionality
  - Search for fellow users by name and view their profile information
- User connection requests
  - Send fellow users connection requests
  - View all pending connection requests
  - **NEW: Accept or reject user connection requests**

## How to Build and Run

### Prerequisites
- Docker (Reccomended)
- GnuCOBOL (Alternative) (macOS: `brew install gnu-cobol`)

### Build
```bash
make
```

Or if you would prefer to run them yourself:
```bash
mkdir -p bin
cobc -Isrc/ -x -o bin/inCollege src/inCollege.cob
```

### Run
If in Docker/Linux, you can run using test.sh. You are responsible for building the application before running. It will automatically pull the correct input files and run the full suite of tests (which are located in input-files/). The output for each test is stored in bin/test-output. The command line output is piped into bin/test-output/cli-output.txt for easy comparison. See TESTING-GUIDE.md for an explanation of each test.
```bash
./run-tests.sh
```
Running the `-b` flag will build the program before running the tests
```bash
./run-tests.sh -b
```

Alternatively you can copy the input file into bin/ (or wherever the binary is), rename it to `input.txt`, cd into bin, and then run the executable.
Notes: You must ensure that your input file is named `input.txt`. It also must be in the directory you are currently in (eg if you run the program while in the main project folder with `./bin/inCollege`, ensure that `input.txt` is also in the main project folder).
Example commands:
```bash
make
cp <your input file> bin/input.txt
cd bin
./inCollege
```

## Input/Output Files

### Input File: `input.txt`
The program reads all user inputs from this file. input.txt must be located in the directory you are in when running the binary. Each line represents a single input:
- Menu choices
- Usernames and passwords
- Navigation choices within logged-in menus

### Output File: `output.txt`
All program output is mirrored to this file, identical to console output.

### Accounts File: `acct-database.dat`
User accounts and profiles are persisted in this indexed file (created automatically). Each account record includes:
- Username and password
- Complete profile information (name, university, major, graduation year)
- About Me section
- Up to 3 work experience entries
- Up to 3 education entries

## Sample Test

Create `input.txt` with this content to test the complete flow:
```
1
u-demo
Passw0rd!
0
u-demo
Passw0rd!
1
John
Doe
University of Example
Computer Science
2025
Enthusiastic developer always learning new things.
DONE
DONE
2
q
```

This test will:
1. Create a new account (u-demo with Passw0rd!)
2. Login with the created account
3. Create a profile with required fields and About Me
4. View the created profile
5. End program

### Profile Test Files
- `profile-test-basic.txt`: Basic profile creation test
- `profile-test-complete.txt`: Complete profile with experience/education
- `profile-test-validation.txt`: Input validation test cases

## Testing Different Scenarios

### Test Account Creation
```
1
username
Password1!
```

### Test Login
```
0
username
Password1!
```

### Test Invalid Password
```
1
user
short
```

### Test Account Limit (after 5 accounts exist)
```
1
user6
Password1!
```

## Reset State
To start fresh testing:
```bash
rm acct-database.dat
rm output.txt
```

## Expected Output Format
The program displays an ASCII-art menu and all output is mirrored to `output.txt`. Console and file outputs are identical.
